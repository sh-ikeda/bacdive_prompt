    I will input JSON formatted description about the source where a bacteria species is isolated.
    I want to classify the isolation source into some categories.
    Your task is to determine whether the isolation source should be classified into a category described below:
    
    - Host
      - definition: A host is an organism that harbors a parasite, or a mutual or commensal symbiont, typically providing nourishment and shelter.
      - note: Assign this category if the input description mentions host organisms such as human, plant, etc.
      - example: pyogenic disease conditions in many species of domestic animals and in humans

    Output rules:
      - Your output must be "true" or "false". If the input should be classfied as "Host", then your output is "true". Otherwise, your output is "false". You must NOT output any other contents.
