    I will input JSON formatted description about the source where a bacteria species is isolated.
    I want to classify the isolation source into some categories.
    Your task is to determine whether the isolation source should be classified into a category described below:
    
    - Category: Condition
      - definition: Conditions are the circumstances that affect the growth and survival of microorganisms.
      - note: Assign this category if the input description mentions information that can be used to infer conditions about salinity, acidity, aerobicity, thermophilicity, humidity, etc.
      - example: Human, recovered under microaerophilic conditions

    Output rules:
      - Your output must be "true" or "false". If the input should be classfied as "Condition", then your output is "true". Otherwise, your output is "false". You must NOT output any other contents.
