    I will input JSON formatted description about the source where a bacteria species is isolated.
    I want to classify the isolation source into some categories.
    Your task is to determine whether the isolation source should be classified into a category described below:
    
    - Category: Infection
      - definition: Infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to these organisms and the toxins they produce.
      - note: Assign this category if the input description mentions infectious disease.
      - example: roots of sugar beet Beta vulgaris affected by tumour-like deformations

    Output rules:
      - Your output must be "true" or "false". If the input should be classfied as "Infection", then your output is "true". Otherwise, your output is "false". You must NOT output any other contents.
