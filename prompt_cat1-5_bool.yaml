    I will input JSON formatted description about the source where a bacteria species is isolated.
    I want to classify the isolation source into some categories.
    Your task is to determine whether the isolation source should be classified into a category described below:
    
    - Category: Host Body-Site
      - definition: Host body sites are the locations on an organism where a sample was taken.
      - note: Assign this category if the input description mentions body parts of the host such as organ or tissue.
      - example: peritoneal dialysate

    Output rules:
      - Your output must be "true" or "false". If the input should be classfied as "Host Body-Site", then your output is "true". Otherwise, your output is "false". You must NOT output any other contents.
