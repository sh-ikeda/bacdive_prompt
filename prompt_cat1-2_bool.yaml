    I will input JSON formatted description about the source where a bacteria species is isolated.
    I want to classify the isolation source into some categories.
    Your task is to determine whether the isolation source should be classified into a category described below:
    
    - Environmental
      - definition: Environments are sites that are characterized by specific physical, chemical, and biological properties.
      - note: Assign this category if the input description mentions environmental information such as terrestrial, aquatic, air, etc. Note that human-made environments such as wastewater or composting are not included in this category.
      - example: acidic mineral environment

    Output rules:
      - Your output must be either "true" or "false".
